## Architecture

### Collections Schema
- **users**: User profiles with admin flags
- **faqs**: FAQ entries with categories and tags
- **qna**: Community questions with nested answers
- **answers**: Subcollection under qna for threaded discussions

### Authentication Flow
1. Google OAuth sign-in
2. User profile creation/update in Firestore
3. Admin privileges checked for restricted features
4. Session management with Firebase Auth

### Security Rules
- Read access: Public for active content
- Write access: Authenticated users for own content
- Admin access: Full CRUD for privileged users
- Data validation and ownership checks

## Key Components

### Authentication
- `AuthContext.jsx`: Authentication state management
- `useAuth.js`: Authentication hook
- `LoginButton.jsx`: Google sign-in component
- `UserProfile.jsx`: User info display
- `ProtectedRoute.jsx`: Route protection wrapper

### Services
- `firebaseService.js`: Database operations (FAQ, Q&A, Users)
- Comprehensive CRUD operations
- Error handling and data validation

### Pages
- `FAQ.jsx`: Firebase-integrated FAQ system
- `QNA.jsx`: Community Q&A with authentication
- `AdminPanel.jsx`: Admin management interface

### Security
- `firestore.rules`: Database security rules
- `firestore.indexes.json`: Query optimization indexes

## Authentication Requirements

### For Regular Users:
- Must sign in with Google to post questions/answers
- Can like/unlike content
- Can manage their own content

### For Admin Users:
- All regular user privileges
- Can manage all FAQ content
- Can grant/revoke admin privileges
- Can moderate Q&A content
- Access to admin panel

## Configuration Needed

1. **Firebase Project Setup**:
   - Enable Authentication with Google provider
   - Create Firestore database
   - Deploy security rules and indexes

2. **Firebase Config**:
   - Update `firebase.js` with your project credentials
   - Replace placeholder config values

3. **Google OAuth**:
   - Configure OAuth consent screen
   - Add authorized domains

## Usage

### First-Time Setup:
1. Users sign in with Google account
2. Profile automatically created in Firestore
3. Admin manually grants admin privileges to desired users

### Content Management:
- Admins can add/edit/delete FAQs through admin panel
- Users can post questions and answers after authentication
- Like system tracks user engagement

### Security:
- All database operations secured by authentication
- Admin functions restricted to privileged users
- Content ownership enforced by security rules

This implementation provides a complete Firebase-integrated solution with authentication, database operations, and admin management capabilities.
